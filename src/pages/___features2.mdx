# Features

The projects provides a diverse set of insights via dedicated solutions.

## Infrastructure Maps

These maps would show the location of critical infrastructure such as water supplies, power plants, bridges, and roads. They could be color-coded to indicate the current status of each piece of infrastructure (operational, at risk, non-operational)

## Risk Assessment Charts

These charts would show the level of risk for each piece of infrastructure, based on factors such as its location, condition, and the current environmental conditions. This could be represented as a bar chart or pie chart.

## Trend Graphs

These graphs would show trends over time, such as changes in climate conditions, frequency of natural disasters, or changes in the condition of the infrastructure. This could help users identify patterns and make predictions about future risks.

## Disaster Impact Maps

In the event of a natural disaster or conflict, these maps would show the areas most affected and the impact on the infrastructure. This could help users prioritize their response efforts.

## Response Planning Maps

These maps would show planned response efforts, such as areas where resources are being deployed or where repairs are being made.

## Climate Data Graphs

These graphs would show relevant climate data from the Copernicus, such as temperature trends, precipitation levels, or sea level changes.
