## Use Cases

---

### Monitoring Water Quality in Conflict Zones

In regions affected by conflict, access to clean water can often be compromised. We can use the Copernicus data to monitor water bodies in these regions and warn inhabitants about risk of contamination in case of man-made disasters. The data can provide information on various parameters on the surface. This information can help in identifying contamination or other issues affecting the water quality. Once a potential issue is identified, StellOracle can alert Customer 3 or local authorities or aid organizations to take necessary action, such as providing water purification solutions or repairing damaged infrastructure.  


### Infrastructure Stability Post-Natural Disasters

After a natural disaster like an earthquake or a hurricane, it’s crucial to assess the stability of remaining structures for both immediate safety and future recovery planning. We can use Copernicus’s radar and optical satellite imagery to assess the structural integrity of buildings, bridges, roads, and other critical infrastructure. The high-resolution images can help identify structures that have been damaged or are at risk of collapse. This information can guide Customer 1/Customer 2 or emergency response teams and reconstruction efforts, ensuring resources are directed where they’re most needed.  

### Safe Routes for Civic Evacuation

In case of emergency, up-to-date information about state of road, bridges, proximity to sources of contamination with direction and speed of wind as well as flood dynamics will be offered to Customers 1, 2, 3 in a visual form adapted for decision-making and sharing with the general public.  

## How to Use

---

### Access the System

The user will need to log into the StellOracle system. This could be through a web portal, a mobile app, or API interface.

### View Data

Once logged in, the user can view the data collected by the Copernicus and other on-the-ground systems. This data will be presented in a user-friendly format, such as maps, charts, and graphs.

### Receive Alerts

The system will send alerts to the user when there are significant changes in the data that could impact critical infrastructure. For example, if a natural disaster is predicted in a certain area, the system could send an alert to the user.

### Take Action

Based on the data and alerts, the user can take appropriate action to protect and maintain critical infrastructure. This could involve deploying resources to a certain area, implementing disaster response plans, or making adjustments to infrastructure planning.

### Provide Feedback

The user can provide feedback on the system’s performance and usability. This feedback will be used to make continuous improvements to the system as well as to add additional information to the corresponding disaster map.
